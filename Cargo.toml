description = "Rust implementation of a novel de novo clustering algorithm. isONclust3 is a tool for clustering either PacBio Iso-Seq reads, or Oxford Nanopore reads into clusters, where each cluster represents all reads that came from a gene family. Output is a tsv file with each read assigned to a cluster-ID and a folder 'fastq' containing one fastq file per cluster generated. Detailed information is available in the isONclust3 paper."
